is without you!

### Community Survey coming soon

### [Upcoming Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/calendar)

We are moving into conference season with DevConf.cz, FOSDEM and CfgMgmtCamp coming up.

All Foreman events are available via [the forum
calendar](https://community.theforeman.org/calendar) - hit the Subscribe button
(which will give you an ICS link). You can also use the "Add To Calendar" button
on specific events if you don't wish to import the whole thing.

Future community demos will now be created much further in advance, so you
should be able to keep up with upcoming demos there.

* [Community Demo #55](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-55)

All the usual goodness from the community, rounded up and presented for your viewing pleasure.
