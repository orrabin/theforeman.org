Welcome back to the Foreman Newsletter! After a few months full of conferences 
that kept our community team very busy, we are now back for good :) 


### 1.24 RC2 && Katello 3.14 RC1 are out!

The first release candidate for [1.24][1_24_rc2] was released! That is not a mistake,
we had to skip RC1. Please [take part](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-1-24-test-week/16268)
in our testing of the release candidates!
Look out for RC3 which should be coming out this week!

Katello's first elease candidate for [3.14][k_3_14_rc1] is also out!
We're looking forward to see [any issues][k_issues] reported soon.

more details [here][k_3_13_1] and please do report any [issues][k_issues].

As ever, many thanks to the contributors to these releases - coders, RC testers,
documentation writers, and bug/feature reporters. Foreman wouldn't be what it
is without you!

All Foreman events are available via [the forum
calendar](https://community.theforeman.org/calendar) - hit the Subscribe button
(which will give you an ICS link). You can also use the "Add To Calendar" button
on specific events if you don't wish to import the whole thing.

* [Community Demo #70](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-70)

Every few weeks we host a Community Demo to showcase new & interesting developments from the Foreman community. We encourage participation from any member of the community (although you do need a Google account), so if youâ€™ve been working on something cool, please do come show it off.

* FOSDEM & CfgMgmtCamp - our stand has been accepted to both! Look out for more details
in next month's newsletter!

#### [Past Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/latest)

* [Community Demo #69](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-69)

For those of you that have been following our demos live, we have been experiencing
technical issues with the live broadcast.
This is a result of YouTube dropping the option to use Hangouts on Air.
We are working on other live solutions but for now all of our demos are recorded and
uploaded right after the time slot we publicize.

If anyone would like to join us live, please reach out and we'll send out a link we use
for the presenters. 

### New Maintainers

This month we have 3 new maintainers in the Foreman core repo!
Congratulations and good luck to Avi Sharvit, Amir Feferkuchen and
Shira Maximov! We hope to see you active and bring the open PR number
way down!
