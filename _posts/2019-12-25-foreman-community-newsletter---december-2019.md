### 1.24 released!

As ever, many thanks to the contributors to this release - coders, RC testers,
documentation writers, and bug/feature reporters. Foreman wouldn't be what it

* [Community Demo #72](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-72)

Every few weeks we host a Community Demo to showcase new & interesting developments from
the Foreman community. We encourage participation from any member of the community
(although you do need a Google account), so if youâ€™ve been working on something cool,
please do come show it off.


#### [Past Events](https://community.theforeman.org/c/events/l/latest)

* [Community Demo #71](https://community.theforeman.org/t/foreman-community-demo-71)

For those of you that have been following our demos live, we have been experiencing
technical issues with the live broadcast.
This is a result of YouTube dropping the option to use Hangouts on Air.
We are working on other live solutions but for now all of our demos are recorded and
uploaded right after the time slot we publicize.

If anyone would like to join us live, please reach out and we'll send out a link we use
for the presenters.

### Looking for a new Community Manager

Almost a year after the community team started we now see we have enough activity
to add a new lead. Pulp community has also grown and are looking for someone
dedicated to their community. As a result we are now searching for a new Community Manager
for Pulp and Foreman communities.
If you know anyone that would be interested see the full details on the
[forum](https://community.theforeman.org/t/open-position-foreman-and-pulp-community-manager/16744/2). 

### Acknowledgements
